# Description
This project uses the power of node.js to generate a README.md file for a user, based solely on a short series of prompts. The "Inquirer" node module is used to produce the prompts, which allow the user to populate the file with the project's title, a unique table displaying the languages used, an interactive table of contents, a description, installation instructions, usage instructions, credits, links to their GitHub profile and email address, any tests included, and any license selected with a link to the documentation of said license. A badge that corresponds to the license selected is also displayed. If no license or test is entered, these selections, as well as the badge, will not display.
