# Description
This project uses the power of node.js to generate a README.md file for a user, based solely on a short series of prompts. The "Inquirer" node module is used to produce the prompts, which allow the user to populate the file with the project's title, a unique table displaying the languages used, an interactive table of contents, a description, installation instructions, usage instructions, credits, links to their GitHub profile and email address, any tests included, and any license selected with a link to the documentation of said license. A badge that corresponds to the license selected is also displayed. If no license or test is entered, these selections, as well as the badge, will not display.

## Installation
To utilize this project, clone this repository onto your machine by running the command "git clone" followed by the contents provided in the green "code" dropdown near the top of this page in your command-line shell. Once the contents are copied to your machine, open the directory in your text-editor of choice. From your shell, install the necessary node modules by navigating to the main directory and running the command "npm install". Once the packages have downloaded, the application is now ready to use.

## Usage
Once everything is installed, using the application is easy. Within the main directory, simply run the command "node index.js" to initiate the prompts. Answer the prompts as you would like your readme.md to be filled out, and at the end, you will see a new file in the main directory called "sampleREADME.md". This is your newly generated readme file, and yours to do with as you wish.

Watch this quick run through to observe how the application is used (but include more content in your readme than is demonstrated here!)

## Credits
This was a solo project inspired by the staff at the UC Berkeley full-stack coding bootcamp. Thanks to those instructors and my fellow classmates for providing the knowledge and the incentive.
